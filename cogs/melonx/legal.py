                'Read about the landmark case [**Sony v. Bleem!** (2000)](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/summaries/sonycomputer-bleem-9thcir2000.pdf), ' +
                'which helped set the precedent for emulation being legal. You can also watch ' +

                '## Legal Basis\n' +
                'According to the [**U.S. Copyright Act**](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#117) ' +
                '(the law under which Discord operates), you **must own a legal copy** of any game you play on **MeloNX**.\n\n' +
                '- Downloading games you do not own is considered **piracy** and is **illegal**.\n' +
                '- Even if another copy is identical, it still belongs to someone else, you are **not entitled** to it.\n\n' +
                '## Our Stance on Piracy\n' +
                'We **do not support piracy**. Doing so would give Nintendo legal grounds to take us down.\n' +
                'And yes â€” **Nintendo is aware of MeloNX\'s existence.**\n\n' +
                'We are not required to monitor user behavior, but we **strongly encourage** everyone to use only **legally obtained copies** of games.\n\n' +
                '## Enforcement\n' +
                'If you are found using pirated games with MeloNX, you will be **banned** from this Discord server **without warning**.\n\n' +
                '## Final Note\n' +
                'Thank you for understanding and respecting the hard work that went into creating both the emulator MeloNX is built on, ' +
